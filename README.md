## Movie Recommendation System using R Programming

As the business needs are accelerating, there is an increased dependence on extracting meaningful information from humongous amount of raw data to drive business solutions. Also, with the increase in the amount of available information, new problems arise as people are finding it hard to select the items they want to see or use. This is where the recommender system comes in. They help us make decisions by learning our preferences or by learning the preferences of similar users.
Recommender systems are one of the most popular algorithms in data science today. They possess immense capability in various sectors ranging from entertainment to e-commerce. 

Recommender Systems have proven to be instrumental in pushing up company revenues and customer satisfaction with their implementation.

They are used by almost every major company in some form or the other. Netflix uses it to suggest movies to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.
In this project, a collaborative filtering recommender (CFR) system for recommending movies is developed.

The theory behind collaborative filtering to work with collaboration with user or movie id. For example, there are two user A and B, user A likes movie P,Q,R,S and user B like movies Q,R,S,T. Since movies Q, R and S are common for both users, therefore, movie P will be recommended to user B and movie T will be recommended to user A. The collaborative filtering approach considers only user preferences and does not consider the features or contents of the items (books or movies) being recommended.
